    "\n",
    "1. **Key Factors for Statistical Testing:** ChatGPT explained that the key factor distinguishing ideas that can be statistically tested is *measurability*. Hypotheses must involve variables that can be observed and quantified using data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Criteria for a Good Null Hypothesis:** A good null hypothesis is *specific*, *testable*, and represents no effect or difference. It should allow for clear statistical testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Difference Between Null and Alternative Hypotheses:** The *null hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ)* states there is no effect or difference (e.g., \"the treatment has no impact\"), while the *alternative hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ)* suggests that there is an effect or difference (e.g., \"the treatment improves outcomes\"). The goal of hypothesis testing is to evaluate whether the sample data provides enough evidence to reject H‚ÇÄ in favor of H‚ÇÅ.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Distinction Between Population Parameters and Sample Statistics:** ChatGPT clarified that hypothesis testing aims to draw conclusions about the population mean (Œº), not just the sample mean (xÃÑ). The sample mean (xÃÑ) represents the average of data points in the sample (ùë•·µ¢), but the goal is to infer something about the true mean of the entire population (Œº). The null hypothesis (Œº‚ÇÄ) is tested to see if it can be rejected in light of the sample data.\n",

    "We worked together to adjust the code from \"Demo II of Week 5 TUT\" in order to compute a p-value for a one-sided (one-tailed) hypothesis test rather than the two-sided (two-tailed) version provided. Below are the key points discussed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Two-Sided Test Code**:\n",
    "    - The original code simulates 10,000 random improvements in health scores under the null hypothesis (that the vaccine has no effect). The code checks for \"as or more extreme\" results, where \"extreme\" means being far from the hypothesized parameter (0.5) in both directions (two-tailed).\n",
    "    - The p-value is calculated based on how many of the simulated statistics are as extreme or more extreme than the observed statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Changes for One-Sided Test**:\n",
    "    - To convert the test from two-tailed to one-tailed, we adjusted the part of the code that checks for extreme values. Instead of checking both sides, we only checked one side (right tail), focusing on whether the simulated statistics were greater than the observed statistic.\n",
    "    - The line that was modified:\n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      SimStats_as_or_more_extreme_than_ObsStat = simulated_statistics >= observed_statistic\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "    - This change restricts the p-value calculation to one tail of the sampling distribution, representing a one-sided test.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Expected Outcome**:\n",
    "    - A one-tailed test generally leads to a smaller p-value compared to a two-tailed test because we are only considering one direction of extremity. This can lead to stronger evidence against the null hypothesis if the observed statistic aligns with the direction we are testing for.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Conclusion**:\n",
    "    - By narrowing the focus of the test to one side, we refined the hypothesis test to specifically test if health scores improved, rather than testing for any change (improvement or decline).\n",
    "    - The resulting p-value should be smaller because fewer simulated statistics will be considered \"as or more extreme\" in a one-tailed test.\n",
    "\n",
    "This interaction helped me understand how to adapt a two-sided test to a one-sided test and interpret the impact of the change on the p-value calculation."

In this modern version of experiment, we replicate the test with 80 STA130 students to determine whether they can accurately state whether the milk or tea was poured first.

We will now statistically assess whether this result could have occurred by random chance(as assumed by the null hypothesis), or whether there is evidence to reject this assumption.\n",

She correctly identified all eight cups. The current test differs primarily in sample size, where we are testing 80 students rather than just one person. While the original experiment was focused on the capabilities of a single individual, the STA130 test provides a broader measure of the population's general adbility to detect the difference. \n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "If the p-value is small, we will reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is evidence that some students can correctly detect the order in which milk and tea are poured. If the p-value is large, we will fail to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that the correct responses could have been due to random guessing. "

    "The statistical analysis, based on the calculated p-value, will inform whether or not we can reject the null hypothesis. A low p-value would suggest strong evidence that the students' ability to detect the order is not due to chance. A high p-value would suggest that their responses could be random guesses. The results of this analysis will be discussed based on the calculated p-value. "
